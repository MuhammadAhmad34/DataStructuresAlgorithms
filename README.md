## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a collection of DSA-related code and explanations. I've organized the repository to help you navigate through different topics easily. Feel free to explore and use the resources as you see fit.

## Data Structures

Here are some of the key data structures I've covered in this repository:

- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables (HashMaps)
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps (Min-Heaps, Max-Heaps)
- Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, etc.)
- Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find
- Trie

For each data structure, you'll find implementations, explanations, and examples to help you understand their usage and performance characteristics.

## Algorithms

I've also included various algorithms that are essential for problem-solving and coding interviews:

- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
- Divide and Conquer
- String Algorithms

The code examples and explanations provided should help you grasp the logic behind these algorithms and apply them to solve real-world problems efficiently.
